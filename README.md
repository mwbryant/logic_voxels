# Logic Voxels

This is a personal game project created with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).
Development will be overviewed on an upcoming video on [LogicProjects on Youtube](https://youtu.be/_uKWIYEGBjs).
All assets and code were created by LogicProjects (mwbryant) and are free to use in any way without restriction.

Disclaimer: Code is a bit hacky in some places and probably isn't a great example to follow.

# Usage

Run the experimental single binary which creates a server and client in 1 app
```
cargo run
```

Run the standalone server
```
cargo run --bin server
```

Run a client
```
cargo run --bin client
```

# Contributions
This project is currently closed to contributions! This is just a personal fun project for me.
